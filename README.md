# i3config
This is my i3 window manager settings that I use. 

1) Clone the repository and copy its contents to a .i3 folder in your home directory
2) Install all the packages written in requirements.txt
3) Enjoy using the best window manager

Note that you need to uncomment a lot of i3block things in the i3blocks.conf folder to use them
